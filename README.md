# Featured-Developer-ThreeB-Backend

## App Focus
When users log in, this app will show information about the developers in the GDP1 class.

## Key Elements Of Stack
<ol>
<li> We intend to use Java as the backendÂ language with SpringBoot as Framework, as it facilitates the development of rapid app solutions.</li>
<li> Heroku as backend free app host, as it enables to host our code in various languages relatively easily.</li>
<li> We are planning to use Heroku PostgreSQL as Database. </li>
<li> We propose to create the application using Vue on the front end. As Vue enables developers to use ordinary HTML for front-end development rather than writing sophisticated JS code. In addition, the framework may generate reusable parts from view data. The ability to create custom elements improves code reuse and accelerates development.</li>
 <li> We are planning for Bootstrap and Flex for Front-end responsive design.</li>
<ol>
